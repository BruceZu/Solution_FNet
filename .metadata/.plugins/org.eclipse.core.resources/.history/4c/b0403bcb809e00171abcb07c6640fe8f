 * Problem 4: Implementation of Singleton class
 * Solution:
 * The Singleton pattern is a design pattern which specifies that a class can be 
 * instantiated only once and access to that one single instance is provided. 
 * 
 * We can implement it in 2 ways:
 * 1. Lazy Initialization
 * 2. Eager Initialization
