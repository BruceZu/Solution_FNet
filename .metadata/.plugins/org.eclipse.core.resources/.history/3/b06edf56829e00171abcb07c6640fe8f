/*
 * Problem 4: Implementation of Singleton class
 * Solution:
 * The Singleton pattern is a design pattern which specifies that a class can be 
 * instantiated only once and access to that one single instance is provided. 
 * 
 * We can implement it in 2 ways:
 * 1. Lazy Initialization - here as shown in the code below, a new instance is created
 * only if it does not exist. 
 * 2. Eager Initialization - here always a new instance is created even
 * though we necessarily don't need it
 * 
 * The following are the 2 implementations for SingleTon
 * */

		 * Constructor here is made private to ensure that no one can
		 * instantiate this class

			singletonInstance = new SingletonImplementation();
