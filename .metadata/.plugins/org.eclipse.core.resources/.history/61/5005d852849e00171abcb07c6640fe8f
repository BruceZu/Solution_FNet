/*
 * Problem 4: Implementation of Singleton class
 * Solution:
 * The Singleton pattern is a design pattern which specifies that a class can be 
 * instantiated only once and access to that one single instance is provided. 
 * 
 * We can implement it in 2 ways:
 * 1. Lazy Initialization - here as shown in the code below, a new instance is created
 * only if it does not exist. 
 * 2. Eager Initialization - here always a new instance is created even
 * though we necessarily don't need it (Check SingletonImplementationEager.java)
 * 3. Thread-safe Initialization- here it is very similar to the Lazy initialization
 * but the getInstance method has to be made "synchronized" to ensure
 * thread safety  
 * */

		if (instance == null)
			instance = new SingletonImplementationLazy();
		return instance;
